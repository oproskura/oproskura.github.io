      <h3 class="text-center py-3 ">Here's interesting facts about Bruce Dickinson:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>He is a fully licensed commercial pilot. He's been flying his own planes since the late 1990s, early 2000s.
          This started around the time of his album The Chemical Wedding. He mentioned that he had family in the RAF
          (Royal Air Force for those who may not know) and since finding out that, he developed an interest in aviation.
        </li>
        <li>His birth name was Paul Bruce Dickinson. Paul is his proper first name. The "Bruce" part came from his
          father, Bruce Dickinson Sr. In school, he obviously went by his proper first name of Paul, but when he went
          into music, he simply went by Bruce.</li>
        <li>He was born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, England. For those familiar with the Legend of Robin Hood, this
          area is where the notorious Sheriff of Nottingham was said to be from. This area is actually a pretty big
          industrial area, lots of factories and mills and coal mines.</li>
        <li>He has a Bachelor's Degree from the University of London. What his book, What Does This Button Do? An
          Autobiography also mentions is that he attended Queen Mary College in London and received a degree in English
          and History.</li>
        <li>Fans of Iron Maiden gave him the nickname "The Air Raid Siren" because of his incredibly powerful vocals,
          that, when he gets those vocals high enough, sounds like an air raid siren.</li>
        <li>He was married twice. His first wife was his college sweetheart Jane. His second wife, Paddy Bowden is the
          mother of their three kids: Austin, who is the lead singer of a successful metal band called As Lions,
          previously known as Rise to Remain, Griffin is the lead singer of a metal band called SHVPES and Kia
          Dickinson.</li>
        <li>In addition to being a highly qualified commercial airline pilot, he is more than qualified to fly passenger
          airplanes. Just imagine if there was a plane of people going somewhere on vacation and those people are Maiden
          fans and they hear Bruce Dickinson announce himself as one of their pilots taking them to their destination.
          That would probably make those fans' lives complete.</li>
        <li>1990 saw the release of his first solo album, Tattooed Millionaire. Things at that point were going downhill
          since the 1986 album Somewhere in Time was released. Bruce was frustrated with the fact that he was writing
          just as many songs as bassist Steve Harris, yet his songs were being ignored because they were Bryan
          Adams-type songs and Spanish guitar type songs that Steve felt didn't belong in the band. At that point, he
          thought long and hard about a solo album. And to his luck, he was able to help his good friend Janick Gers,
          who was seriously thinking about selling his musical gear to go back to school to pursue a degree in
          humanities. He told Janick not to sell his stuff because an album was in the process and his services were
          required.</li>
        <li>Bruce's first experience with music was when his parents bought him a small record of Chubby Checker's "The
          Twist".</li>
        <li>Bruce worked on his pilot's license by flying commercially in Florida in the late 1990s, early 2000s.</li>
        <li>Prior to singing, Bruce wanted to play drums like Ian Paice of Deep Purple, who is, to this day, still one
          of Bruce Dickinson's all time favorite bands.</li>
        <li>In his spare time, he wrote two adult-type graphic novels called The Adventures of Lord Iffy Boatrace and
          The Missionary Position.</li>
        <li>In 2015, Bruce underwent chemotherapy treatments for cancer of the head and neck, a very rare type of
          cancer. He had just finished recording his vocals for Iron Maiden's then album The Book of Souls. He had gone
          to the doctor and found out he had cancer after a growth was found on the back of his tongue.</li>
        <li>His first autobiography, written completely by him, called What Does This Button Do? An Autobiography, was
          released on 10/19/2017.</li>
        <li>From 2002-2010, he had his own rock and metal radio show on BBC Radio 6 Music.</li>
        <li>He left the band Samson, then considered leading lights of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement, to
          join Iron Maiden in 1981. His first album with Iron Maiden was 1982's The Number of the Beast, whitch knocked
          Barbra Streisand off the top of the UK album chart in April 1982.</li>
        <li>Many Iron Maiden fans will already know Bruce is a fencing expert, having represented Britain at the
          European Cup in 1989, but his autobiography What Does This Button Do? also reveals Bruce actually swapped from
          right-handed to left-handed combat after a decade of training.</li>
        <li>When not flying around the world in airplanes, touring heavily with Iron Maiden or keeping his fencing
          skills up to par, he can be found hanging around West London, specifically the coffee shops of West London.
